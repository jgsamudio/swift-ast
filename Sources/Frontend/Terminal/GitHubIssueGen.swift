  ### Issue Summary
  [Insert a brief but thorough description of the issue]

  I tried to invoke `swift-ast` with the command:
  `swift-ast \(filePath)`

  And it interprets the path and converts it to:
  `\(absolutePath)`

  Then `swift-ast` couldn't read from that path.

  ### Environment
  - OS Info: \(getOSInfo())
  - Yanagiba/swift-ast version: \(Version.current.library)

  ### Even Better
  Is your project open sourced? If yes, can you point us to your repository?
  If not, is it possible to make a small project that fails the Travis CI?
  If not, can you create a gist with your sample code for us?
